# Getting to Know Yaws (<i>Treponema pallidum pertenue</i>)
Let's learn about a once forgotten pathogen which is now on it's way to being eliminated by the World Health Organization (WHO)!

Yaws is a spirochete bacterium which is closely related to syphillus; in fact they belong to the same species, but are classified as different sub-species. Despite being taxonomically closely related, Yaws is very different from Syphillus: it is spread by skin-to-skin contact, and is commonly found among children in tropical regions.

Because Yaws infection is fairly easy to treat using standard antibiotics, it is currently slated for worldwide eradication efforts. It is currently estimated that elimination will be acheived by 2020.
